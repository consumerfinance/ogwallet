### 🛑 Financial App Specifics:

4\. Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

6\. Enforcement

### Why this matters for your project:

*   **Builds Trust:** By having a clear CoC, you tell the **TechnoFino** community that you are a serious maintainer who won't tolerate toxic behavior or data leaks.

*   **Sets Boundaries:** It explicitly forbids "Financial Trolling"—preventing people from intentionally messing up your crowdsourced rewards data.

*   **Standardizes Moderation:** If you ever need to ban someone for being a "troll" in the Microsoft Form, you have a written policy to point to.
